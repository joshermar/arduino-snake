# Arduino Snake

Play Snake on your TV simply using an Arduino board, a joystick and two resistors, that's it!

## Requirements
- Arduino board (tested on Arduino Uno)
- Joystick module, such as this one: https://arduinomodules.info/ky-023-joystick-dual-axis-module/
- Two resistors: 1K Ohm and 470 Ohm
- RCA/Composite/AV Cable

Many arduino starter kits come with all the components you need (except for the AV cable obviously).

More info on the TVout library and on setting up the board to output a video signal can be found here:  https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/paulscott56/arduino-tv-out-cable-64de69
